# Training Iris
This is part of a series of projects created for the purpose of familiarizing myself with the concepts of machine learning and data science.

The Iris dataset is a classic for machine learning. It is perfect for beginners, with clean data and low number of features (4). This feature count can even be reduced and retrained quickly to plot on a 2-D figure for easy presentation.
